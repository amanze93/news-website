          Ferrari admit they have held talks with world champion Lewis Hamilton about joining them in the future.
          Ferrari chief executive officer Louis Carey Camilleri said at a media lunch that Hamilton has had "conversations" with chairman John Elkann.

          Camilleri said Ferrari were "very flattered Lewis in particular, and other drivers, want to join us".
          
          "It's totally premature - we'll look at our options at the appropriate time and see what is the best fit," he added.
          
          Hamilton refuses to confirm or deny Ferrari meeting
          He added that the meeting between the British driver and Elkann was at "a social event, which has been blown somewhat out of proportion - they have some common friends".
          
          Hamilton, who is 35 next month and will be gunning for a record-equalling seventh world title in 2020, comes to the end of his Mercedes contract next season.
          
          He said at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on 1 December that it was "smart and wise" to consider his next move carefully, adding: "I love where I am, so it is definitely not a quick decision to go and do something else."
          
          At the time, Hamilton refused to confirm or deny reports in Italy he had met Elkann twice this year.
          
          Hamilton said he was "waiting to see" whether Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff remained with the team.
          
          Wolff has been touted as a potential replacement for F1 chief executive Chase Carey in 2021.
          
          However that prospect has receded in recent weeks, and Camilleri said Ferrari could use its veto to block any move by Wolff to run F1.
          
          "Anybody who has been an active and important player in a certain team within the last years to take on the responsibility at F1 would create a conflict of interest," Camilleri said.
          
          "It would not be a good thing [that Wolff] should ultimately run F1. Our position is if [Ferrari team principal] Mattia Binotto was the candidate to replace Chase, the rest of the paddock would not be too happy.

        The highest-scoring Champions League group stages ever have come to an end with the usual suspects qualifying - but there are some unfamiliar names among the top goalscorers.

        Some 308 goals were scored, beating the 2017-18 record of 306.
        
        So what have we learned so far from this season's tournament?
        
        Lewandowski can end Messi-Ronaldo golden boot dominance

        For each of the past 12 seasons Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi has won the Champions League golden boot - including one year they shared it with Neymar. Messi had four in a row, before Ronaldo's six in a row (including their shared season) before Messi won it again last season.

There has been one man dominating the scoring charts with them for the past eight seasons - but he has yet to win a golden boot - or the Champions League.

Could this be Robert Lewandowski's season? Since the start of 2011-12 the Pole has scored 62 goals - only one fewer than Messi. Ronaldo is the only other player to score more, with 90 goals in his last 88 Champions League games.

The three are in a league of their own. The next top goalscorer is Karim Benzema on 38.

This season Lewandowski has scored 10 Champions League goals in five games (he was an unused substitute in the final match against Tottenham), an average of one every 44 minutes. That puts him two above Erling Braut Haaland (more on him soon) with Harry Kane next on six.

Messi and Ronaldo have two goals each.
